# XRDP does not unlock the GNOME keyring by default
# as discussed in the following GitHub issue:
# https://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp/issues/2776
# and the pull request:
# https://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp/pull/2780
#
# This should be fixed in v10 of XRDP, but for v9
# we just need to add the keyring unlocking to the
# XRDP sesman PAM config
