This command guides you through the process of mounting your AARNet CloudStor
storage to your Nectar instance.

To mount your CloudStor storage, you will be prompted for a username and
password. You can generate specific use 'app passwords' from the security
settings of your CloudStor account here:
  https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/settings/personal?sectionid=security

PLEASE NOTE: If you snapshot this instance and share it, your CloudStor
app password may be exposed though the configuration file /etc/davfs2/secrets.
For more information, please see the CloudStor setup article at:
  https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000211327
